Ref Scrapers
Inbox scraper - getnada:  click button and then drop down form will show ->fixed drop down
Guerilla scraper: drop down appears easily -> fixed drop down
MailCatch scraper: static data, just go to that xpath and by id fetch data ->static website
TempMail scraper: Where there is dynamic data generation like copy button available and diff domains gen  -> dynamic

There are plenty of functions selenium can offer, just think how you have extract certain info and then work with selenium

Documentation for Xpath:

Fake Mail, Minute Inbox, Ten Min Mail, Mail Catch, Temp Mail static, inbox kitten, tempail
Guerilla, Inboxes with Drop down

Make generic script for all these
Tomorrow make drop down scrapers more generic

Separate the dynamic and static scrapers

In office I will make generic scrapers and include all the scrapers that have been added so far, think if some code needs to be changed
